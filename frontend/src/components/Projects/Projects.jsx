                    <p>We created imaginary startup for this course. It consisted two teams: frontend and backend. During the course we had a customer buing our product, who gave us suggestions and asked for improvements.</p>
                    <p>Reparo offers a place where people meet to get their clothes fixed or to provide repairing services. You can list your broken items for repairing or you can offer to repair others. Afterwards you can give review for the user. We also implemented admin panels for managing users and content.</p>
                    <p>As member of the frontend-team, I participated designing the application. This web application is made with React and designed with Figma.</p>
